You must download the model's save from the OneDrive link (it's the "move_gnn_01.pt" file)

Then, you construct an instance of the moveFeature class. The method "processFrame" will return the output of the model (for now it's a 3 dimension vector). Use the dummy in the processFrame method to create the input to that method, and have an idea on the input format of the model.
